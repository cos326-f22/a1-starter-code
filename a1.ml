(* Use the following equations to define a function sin_pi that returns
 * the ith approximation of pi.

 * approx(0) = 3
 * approx(n+1) = approx(n) + sin(approx(n))

 * Using this approximation, you will converge on many digits of pi very
 * fast.  The first few digits of pi are 3.14159 26535 89793 23846 26433.
 * Approximation 1 accurately predicts these digits:  3.141
 * Approximation 2 accurately predicts these digits:  3.14159 26535
 * Approximation 3 accurately predicts these digits:  3.14159 26535 89793
 *

(* The type signature for sin_pi is:

(* sin_pi should call the function bad_pi i if its argument i is less than 0 *)


(* Problem 7 - Collatz Sequence *)
(* A Collatz sequence beginning with x0 is a series of positive integers

 * x0 x1 x2 x3 x4 ...

 * such that for all i >= 0, the value of x[i+1] may be computed from the
 * value of x[i] as follows:

 * x[i+1] = x[i] / 2 if x[i] is even
 * x[i+1] = 3*x[i] + 1 if x[i] is odd

 * The Collatz Conjecture states that no matter what positive number x0 you
 * start a Collatz sequence with, the sequence will eventually reach the
 * number 1 --- ie, for any Collatz sequence, there exists an i such that
 * ith element of the sequence is 1. Whenever you reach 1, you will enter
 * an infinite cycle 4 2 1 4 2 1 4 2 1 ...
 * We say that the length of the Collatz sequence beginning with x0 is the
 * number of elements in the sequence up to and including the first
 * occurrence of 1.

 * Here are some Collatz sequences, with their lengths in parenthesis afterwards:

 * 12, 6, 3, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1 (10)
 * 19, 58, 29, 88, 44, 22, 11, 34, 17, 52, 26, 13, 40, 20, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1 (21)
 * 2, 1 (2)
 * 1 (1)

 * Write a function collatz : int -> int such that:
     * collatz n = 0,    if n <= 0, or
     * collatz n = k,    if n > 0 where k is the length of the
                           Collatz sequence starting at n.

 * Note:  If the Collatz sequence beginning with some n never reaches 1,
   your function does not have to terminate on that input n.

 * Note2:  Extra credit if your function raises an exception on
   inputs that never reach 1 (and only those inputs).
   This is a joke.
   And not joke: you'd certainly get lots of extra credit
    if you could prove that you've done that correctly,
    and by the way you'd be instantly famous.  See also:
   https://www.quantamagazine.org/mathematician-terence-tao-and-the-collatz-conjecture-20191211/

 * Note 3: As a practical matter, not related to Note 2,
   if 3x+1 exceeds the integers that can be represented in 63 bits or
   whatever, OCaml may silently overflow into negative numbers,
   or wrong positive numbers.  Don't worry about getting
   correct results on inputs that lead to this kind of overflow.
